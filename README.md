# 📰 Fake News & Misinformation Detection Toolkit

This project presents a practical methodology and open-source toolkit for verifying **fake news**, **phishing emails**, **WhatsApp hoaxes**, and **social media posts**. Built during the Cyber Gyan Virtual Internship, it explores widely-used OSINT tools and platforms that help detect misinformation, manipulated media, and suspicious digital content.

## 📘 Project Overview

The increasing spread of misinformation through digital platforms has made media verification a critical need in cybersecurity, journalism, and public awareness. This project focuses on identifying fake information using a wide range of freely available verification tools and documenting the process through real-world examples.

The project includes:

- Verifying fake headlines and viral news
- Analyzing phishing emails and suspicious domains
- Investigating WhatsApp message credibility
- Detecting reused or AI-generated media content
- Documenting common Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

> 🎓 This project is educational and promotes digital media literacy and misinformation awareness.
